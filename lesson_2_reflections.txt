What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- when you initialize you get a message telling you that git is initialized
with  files in the directory if files are present.

- This need to be done to create a repository so to commit the file

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- you can add or remove only the files that you want to commit
- its helps to do logical commits.
